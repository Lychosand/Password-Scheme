#Purpose

This parser was created using node JS on a windows 10 operating system.  To run this program
you must use node JS.  The purpose of this parser was to extract the important information
out of logged data during user testing.  The input user data and the output user data
can be found in the Password Scheme/User Data directory.  The input file is data.csv,
the output file is parseddata.csv.  Note that this has already been done and the
parsed data is included in the User Data file.
